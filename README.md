# linear-regression

This week is meant to serve as a transition period between strict formalism
(e.g., Bayesian-ism) and detailed application (e.g., MCMC). As such, it is
designed to introduce students to ways of thinking about statistical modeling
and numerical applications using the (ever insightful) vehicle of linear
regression. Goals for the week include:
- getting comfortable with random variables (reasoning by representation)
- understanding different statistical perspectives on problems
- learning the basics of model construction and comparisons
- finding best-fit solutions (optimizations)
- learning the basics of deriving errors
- (if time permits) basics of matrix manipulation

As with some of the other courses here, the main goal of this course is not
the detailed material we're covering but instead to
(1) get students comfortable thinking about statistical modeling (building
on last week's material), and
(2) motivate why we are interested in sampling from the full posterior
distribution (leading up to subsequent weeks' material).
